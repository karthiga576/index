            <h1>Welcome to World of AI & ML</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Here we are going to see more about AI & ML.Let's dive into this journey:</p>
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) </b> the <strong> development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence</strong>, such as <mark>learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding, by analyzing vast amounts of data to recognize patterns and make decisions</mark>.<u>Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects and respond to human language</u>.They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention<tt> (a classic example being a self-driving car)</tt>.In 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in <b>generative AI (gen AI)</b>, a technology that can create <i>original text, images, video and other content</i>.To fully understand <abbr title="GenerativeAI" >GenAI</abbr>, it’s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: <big>machine learning (ML) and deep learning.</big></p>

            <h3>MachineLearning</h3>
            <p>Directly underneath AI, we have <abbr title="MachineLearning">ML</abbr>, which involves <mark>creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data</mark>. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, <em> linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more</em>.Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a <b>neural network</b><tt>(or artificial neural network)</tt>.A neural network consists of <strong>interconnected layers of nodes<tt> (analogous to neurons)</tt> that work together to process and analyze complex data</strong>. Neural networks are well suited to <u> tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data</u>.The simplest form of machine learning is called <mark>supervised learning</mark>.In <del>unsupervised learning</del><ins>supervised learning</ins>,humans pair each training <small>example </small>with an output label.The goal is for the model to <big>learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data</big>, so it can predict the labels of <i>new, unseen data.</i></p>

        <h3>DeepLearning</h3>
        <p>Deep learning is a <strong> subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks</strong>,that more closely <u>the complex decision-making power of the human brain</u>.It includes an <u>input layer, hidden layers ,and an output layer</u>.These multiple layers enable <b>unsupervised learning: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents</b>.It is well suited to <em> Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks</em> that involve the <i>fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data</i>.</p>

        <section>
        <h3>Generative AI</h3>
        <p>Generative AI, sometimes called <i> gen AI </i>, <mark>refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content</mark> such as<em> long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio </em>and more in response to a user’s prompt or request.At a high level, generative models <u>encode a simplified representation of their training data</u>, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.Generative models have been used for years in statistics to <b>analyze numerical data</b>. But over the last decade, <strong>they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types</strong>.</p>
