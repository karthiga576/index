    <h1>Welcome to Domains of ComputerScience</h1>
    <p><b>Computer science </b> is the <mark>study of computation, information, and automation</mark>.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>Included broadly in the sciences, computer science spans theoretical disciplines <small>(such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) </small>to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).An expert in the field is known as a <b>computer scientist</b>.
    
    <p>The Popular Domains of CS includes Artificial Intelligence and MachineLearning<tt>(AI&Ml)</tt>,DataScience and CyberSecurity.We see definitions of the following domains.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence & MachineLearning</h3>
        <p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>is <strong> broad field of creating machines </strong> can mimic human intelligence, while <b>Machine Learning (ML)</b> is <mark> a subset of AI focused on teaching machines to learn patterns from data</mark> and improve automatically without explicit programming.It involves algorithms and models that enable computers to perform tasks such as <em>problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, and visual perception</em>. AI systems can be <u> rule-based or adaptive </u>,improving through data and experience. They power applications like<i> chatbots, recommendation engines, <del>non autonomous</del><ins> autonomous</ins> vehicles, and medical diagnostics</i>. By mimicking cognitive functions, AI enhances <big>efficiency, innovation, and automation across industries, shaping how humans interact with technology</big>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>DataScience</h3>
        <p>Data Science is the <strong>interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data</strong>. It <mark>combines statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise </mark>to analyze <em>large datasets, uncover patterns, and support decision-making</em>. Core processes include <i>data collection, cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling</i>. By leveraging tools like ,<u> machine learning and big data technologies</u>, data science transforms <mark>raw information into actionable intelligence</mark>, driving innovation, efficiency, and strategic growth across industries.It helps to make<b> better decisions and predictions like how Netflix recommends shows or banks detect fraud.</b>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>CyberSecurity</h3>
        <p><b>Cybersecurity</b> is <strong> practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access</strong>.It involves <mark> defense against threats like malware, phishing, and ransomware, relying on tools (firewalls, antivirus) and human practices(strong passwords, training)</mark>.Its practices is  designed to <u>protect information from cyber threats</u> such as <i>malware, phishing, hacking, and ransomware</i>. By applying<b>encryption, firewalls, authentication, and monitoring tools</b>, cybersecurity ensures <mark> confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources</mark>. For organizations, it is <big>financial loss and reputational damage</big>, while for individuals, <big>it prevents identity theft and fraud</big>. In an increasingly connected world, cybersecurity is <del>non essential</del><ins>essential </ins>to <em>maintain trust, resilience, and safety in digital interactions across personal, professional, and national domains</em>.</p>
