        <h1> Welcome to World of DataScience</h1>
        <p><b>Data science</b> is a <mark> field that applies scientific techniques, algorithms, and computational systems to extract meaningful insights from both structured and unstructured data</mark>. By blending statistics, computer science, and domain expertise, it helps organizations understand complex phenomena, make accurate predictions, and support evidence‑based decision making.The process typically involves <em>collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets</em> to identify patterns, <i>build predictive models, and solve challenging problems</i>. Its influence spans across industries—from <u>shaping business strategies to advancing healthcare solutions</u>.Data science integrates<strong> mathematics, statistical methods, programming skills, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence <tt>(AI)</tt>, and machine learning </strong>with subject‑matter knowledge to uncover hidden opportunities within organizational data. These insights are then used to <mark>guide strategic planning and improve decision making</mark>. As a result <sup>[1][2][3]</sup>, modern organizations increasingly depend on<mark> data scientists to interpret information and deliver actionable recommendations</mark> that drive better outcomes. </p>

        <h3>Tools of DataScience</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>R Studio</dt>
                <dd> - An open source programming language and environment for developing statistical computing and graphics.</dd>
            <dt>Python</dt> 
            <dd>  - Python is a dynamic and flexible programming language. 
            The Python includes numerous libraries, such as <mark>NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, for analyzing data quickly.</mark></dd></dl>
            Beyond programming, data scientists are proficient in <del>small data</del><ins>big data</ins> platforms like<mark> Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, and various NoSQL databases</mark>, which allows them to process and manage massive datasets efficiently.
            <p>Visualization is another critical skill. Depending on the context, they may use:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                <li><strong> Tools: Microsoft Excel or presentation software for quick charts.</strong></li>
                <li>Commercial platforms: Tableau, IBM Cognos for enterprise‑level dashboards.</li>
                <li>Open source libraries: D3.js <tt>(JavaScript for interactive visuals) </tt>and RAW Graphs for custom visualizations.</li>
            </ul>
