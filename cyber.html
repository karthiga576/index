        <h1> Welcome to World of CyberSecurity</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="odd">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><b>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital devices, networks, and sensitive data </b>from threats like<mark> hacking, malware, and phishing</mark>. Also known as<i> Information Security (INFOSEC), Information Assurance (IA)</i>, or System Security.It Protects systems, networks, and personal information and Uses security tools, policies,safe online practices.It also <i>Prevents data theft, system damage, and unauthorized access</i>.</p>
    </section>
</div>

    <section class="even">
        <h3>Types of CyberSecurity</h3>
        <p>There are 7 types of cybersecurity.Let's see more details about these types:</p>
        <h3>Network Security</h3>
        <p><b>Network security</b> focuses on  computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, or disruption. It involves <em>firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption to safeguard data </em> it travels across networks. By monitoring traffic and blocking suspicious activity, network security ensures confidentiality and integrity of communications. It <mark>prevents hackers from exploiting vulnerabilities, stops malware from spreading, and maintains reliable connectivity.</mark> Organizations rely on <strong> strong network security to protect sensitive information, support business operations, and defend against evolving cyber threats</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="odd">
        <h3>Information Security</h3>
        <p><b> Information security</b> <tt>(InfoSec) </tt> <strong> protects data in all forms—digital or physical—from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction</strong>. It ensures <em>confidentiality, integrity, and availability through policies, encryption, and secure storage</em>. InfoSec covers <mark> sensitive business records, personal details, and intellectual property</mark>. By applying access controls, audits, and compliance standards, it reduces risks of data breaches and identity theft. Effective information security <i> builds trust, supports regulatory requirements, and helps organizations maintain resilience against cyberattacks targeting valuable information assets</i>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="even">
        <h3>Application Security</h3>
        <p><b>Application security focuses on securing software and apps from vulnerabilities that attackers exploit</b>. It includes <em>secure coding practices, regular testing, and patching </em>to prevent threats like <small>SQL injection, cross‑site scripting, and buffer overflows</small>. Developers integrate security measures during the software development lifecycle, ensuring apps remain safe once deployed. Application security also involves <mark> user interactions, authentication, and updates</mark>. Strong application security <strong> both businesses and users from data leaks, fraud, and malicious exploitation of software flaws</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="odd">
        <h3>Cloud Security</h3>

        <p><strong> Cloud security protects data, applications, and services hosted in cloud environments</strong>. It combines <big>policies, technologies, and controls to secure resources accessed remotely</big>. <strong> <mark> Key practices include encryption, identity management, and compliance monitoring. </mark></strong> Cloud providers and users share responsibility for <em>safeguarding assets, ensuring resilience against breaches and misconfigurations</em>. Cloud security also addresses risks like <i>unauthorized access, data loss, and service outages</i>. With businesses increasingly relying on cloud platforms, robust cloud security ensures scalability, trust, and safe digital transformation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="even">
            <h4>Endpoint Security</h4>
            <p><strong> Endpoint security defends devices </strong>such as <em>laptops, smartphones, and servers that connect to networks</em>. These endpoints are <mark>common targets for malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks</mark>. Endpoint security solutions include <i> antivirus software, firewalls, and advanced detection tools</i>. By monitoring device activity and enforcing policies, organizations prevent unauthorized access and data theft. Endpoint security is <strong>critical in remote work environments, where personal devices often connect to corporate systems</strong>. Strong endpoint protection ensures <b>secure communication and reduces overall cyber risk</b>.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="odd">
            <h4>IoT Security</h4>
            <p><strong> IoT security protects internet‑connected devices</strong> such as <em>  smart home systems, wearables, and industrial sensors</em>. These devices often have limited built‑in defenses, making them vulnerable to hacking, data theft, and misuse. IoT security involves <em> encryption, authentication, network segmentation, and regular updates to prevent unauthorized access</em>. It also ensures <b> safe communication between devices and cloud platforms</b>. As IoT adoption grows, strong security practices are essential to safeguard personal privacy, business operations, and critical infrastructure from evolving cyber threats.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="even">
            <h3>Operational Security</h3>
            <p><b>Operational security </b>focuses on <strong> processes, decisions, and day‑to‑day operations from information leaks or exploitation</strong>. It involves <mark> critical data, analyzing potential risks, and applying controls to minimize exposure</mark>. OpSec ensures that sensitive information—such as <em>business strategies, financial records, or military plans—remains secure</em>. By combining <b>awareness, discipline, and technology, operational security strengthens resilience against insider threats and external cyberattacks targeting organizational workflows.</b></p>

            <h2>Common Threats</h2>
            
            <h3>Malware</h3>
            <p><b>Malware </b> is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems. It includes <em>viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and ransomware</em>. Malware spreads through infected files, email attachments, or compromised websites. Once inside, it can steal data, corrupt files, or lock systems until a ransom is paid. Effective defenses include <strong> antivirus tools, firewalls, and regular updates </strong>. Malware remains one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats, targeting individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.</p>
            </article>
        <section id="phi">
            <h3>Phishing</h3>
            <p><b>Phishing</b> is a <strong>social engineering attack where cybercriminals trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details</strong>. It often 
                <mark>appears as fake emails, texts, or websites that mimic trusted organizations</mark>. Victims unknowingly provide credentials or click malicious links, leading to identity theft or financial fraud. Phishing is dangerous because it exploits human trust rather than technical flaws.  <strong> Awareness, email filtering, and multi‑factor authentication </strong>are key defenses against this  widespread and evolving cyber threat.</p>
        
            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
            <p><b>Ransomware</b> is a <mark><b>type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid</b></mark>. Attackers demand payment, often in cryptocurrency, to <u>provide a decryption key</u>. Ransomware can<i> cripple businesses, hospitals, and governments by halting operations</i>. It spreads through <strong> phishing emails, malicious downloads, or weak security systems</strong>. <b><i>Preventive measures include regular backups, patching vulnerabilities, and employee training</i>. Ransomware is one of the most financially damaging cyber threats in today’s digital landscape.</p>

        
        
            <h3>Data Breaches</h3>
            <p><b>A data breach </b>occurs <mark><b> when unauthorized individuals gain access to sensitive information, such as <em>personal records, financial data, or intellectual property</em></b></mark>. Breaches often result from <strong> passwords, unpatched software, or insider threats</strong>. The stolen data can be sold, misused, or leaked publicly, causing identity theft and reputational harm. Organizations  <i>must implement encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems to reduce risks</i>. Data breaches <strong> the importance of strong cybersecurity practices to protect both individuals and businesses</strong>.</p>
